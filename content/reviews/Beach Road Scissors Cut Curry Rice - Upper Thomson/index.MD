Famous kali peng restaurant, basically cai fan with with curry and use scissors to cut the liao. I normally get chicken cutlet and egg and some cabbage, priced quite affordably at 6 dollars with very generous ingredients. The curry is not too spicy but is quite thick. The ingredients soaked up all the delicious curry making it very flavorful - 8/10
