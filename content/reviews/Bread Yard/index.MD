Honestly a pretty good experience.\
Prices before GST and service charge!\
The pastas were 8 each.\
The porchetta was 12.

Ordered the mafaldine pesto and the mentaiko pasta. The pesto was really yummy, pasta texture was good and the sauce was scrumptious. The mentaiko pasta,however was a let down. The flavours did not mix well in my opinion. The portion was quite decent and extremely worth for their price!
