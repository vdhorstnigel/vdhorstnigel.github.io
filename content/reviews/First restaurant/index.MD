Food was mediocre and not worth it for the price.
Ordered (Prices without GST)
Sea salt chocolate cold brew - 9.50: Taste pretty good but extremely small portion.
Iced Cafe latte - 7 : Very acidic tasting.
Bacon avo garlic bagel - 20.90: Tasted pretty decent but was served a little cold.
Pulled pork burger - 21.90 : Horrible, was more like a shredded pork burger, pulled pork was thick and dry.

Was quite disappointed with the food, especially seeing all the good reviews recently.
