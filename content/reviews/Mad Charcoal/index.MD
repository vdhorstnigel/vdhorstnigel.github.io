Hidden away at an industrial building near you chu kang mrt. Came here at 7.30pm on a weekend, queue was 20 mins long and 40 mins waiting time for food! Come before 5, if you would like to skip the queue. Ordered the beef brisket platter for $38, sufficient for 2-3 pax. Beef brisket was so tender, literally fell apart when i picked it up. All the meats were chargrilled really well and the char grill taste is extremely strong. Really enjoyed the sweet pork belly sauce. Abit upset that the mash potato and sweet potato cubes were sold out as they were supposedly the best sides. I think the food is slightly expensive, but the quality is really unmatched - 9.5/10

My ranking of the meats is as follows:\
Beef Brisket - 1st\
Chicken - 2nd\
Pork belly - 3rd

girlfriendâ€™s review:
Apart from being really fatty and tender, the beef sat in a savory pool of sauce that was so full of flavor. Same for the pork belly, with its sauce being on the sweeter (and slightly alcoholic) side. The chicken was served with cream which made the dish more decadent. The pork retained the most chargrill flavours and was very crispy yet fatty. For our sides, we chose fries and ratatouille. The fries were standard, lightly salted but still tasty. The ratatouille was pretty normal too, with the vegetables cooked till extremely soft. Overall, I rate it a 7/10
