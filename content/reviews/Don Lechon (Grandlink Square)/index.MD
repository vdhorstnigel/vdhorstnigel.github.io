really like the food here, I think the quality of the pork is amazing and cooked well. Only caveat is the sisig is abit too oily. The price is reasonable given the ingredients used and I like the atmosphere of a family restaurant. Seats are outdoors and limited as well. This place also does deliveries if you’re planning for a party!

Ordered the chopped lechon rice set, huge portion of pork and very crispy - 8/10

Gf review
the sisig hot plate was my favourite between
the two. it was really flavorful and fatty, the egg and the chilli’s paired amazingly well with the rice. my only qualm is that it can be a little oily. - 8/10
