Food was mediocre and not worth it for the price.\
Ordered (Prices without GST)\
Sea salt chocolate cold brew - 9.50: Taste pretty good but extremely small portion.\
Iced Cafe latte - 7: Very acidic tasting.\
Bacon avo garlic bagel - 20.90: Tasted pretty decent but was served a little cold.\
Pulled pork burger - 21.90: Horrible, was more like a shredded pork burger, pulled pork was thick and dry.

Was quite disappointed with the food, especially seeing all the good reviews recently.
