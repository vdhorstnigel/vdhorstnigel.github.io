Honestly, hands down best bahn mi in singapore. Super generous in their ingredients and super flavourful. Extremely
crispy bread and came out super hot and fresh. Pate and butter combo was amazing and made the dish that much more appetizing.

My favourite is the special beef piper lolot which is abit more ex at 10.90, compared to the others averaging around 8.90. But the generous portion of beef wrapped in vegetable justifies it. 9.5/10

Honestly for a hdb bahn mi shop, the prices are slightly more expensive compared to the other bahn mi shop i visited, but their quality of food is like 3x better. Only issue, their seating is children table and chairs, which is a cute aesthetic but may not be accommodating to everyone.
