Well to be honest, this place is a classic supper spot. It’s a very loud and lively environment at 12am. Honestly, i personally haven’t eaten anything other than the rk special(mutton only) with an additional prata kosong on top of it. It fills me up nicely and i feel like it’s the best value on the menu. Adding an extra prata allows the crispiness of the prata while being soaked in the curry goodness - 8/10

Girlfriend’s review
Ordered the chicken briyani but was quite disappointed. Wasn’t very spicy and the chicken was very lean and hence quite dry. The curry given was also lacking in flavor. TBH, just come here for the RK Special, I ended up stealing a lot of bites from it. Overall, chicken briyani - 5/10

Generally, everything on the menu quite expensive compared to other spots. Even cold drinks are like $3+, total damage for 2 kosong prata, 1 rk special and 1 chicken briyani was 26.90
