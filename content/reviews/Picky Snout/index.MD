Ordered the creamy mushroom chicken with rosti - $11 and the saigon pork belly with rosti - $12.50.

Was super excited by all the hype on tiktok but was quite disappointed when i tried it. Rosti was lacking in flavor and just tasted ordinary, could do with more seasoning and less oil. The creamy chicken chop was good, the sauce is certainly the star of the show, the chicken was well charred. The saigon pork belly was decent, but nothing special. Honestly for this price, i expected better. I would say if youâ€™re in the area, you could drop by and try but not worth it to travel here.
