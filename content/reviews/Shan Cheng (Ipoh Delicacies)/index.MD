Tucked away in midview, this place serves pretty authentic ipoh food! Ordered the curry chee chong fan - 7.3, which had a slight lacking of liao, could use abit more for the price 6/10. Kopi o kosong ice was very gao which is traditional to the ipoh/KL style. Order the curry toast - 3.9, the eggs were so fresh and added such a layer of creaminess to the curry, would have preferred if the toast was toasted to add more texture, 8/10.

GF review
ordered the chilli banmian and teh c peng and was very satisfied, i did ask for less spice and it was the perfect amount of spice for me. the noodles were youmian and were very chewy, and the sauce clung to the noodles well. only thing is it might be on the drier side but i felt that it was still yummy. the soup was simple yet tasty. However, the fishballs were lacking in texture. overall banmian gets 8/10. the teh c peng was pretty good as well

Honestly, this place feels like a cozy cafe. It has a nice chill atmosphere, the prices are slightly more pricey but way lower than chains like ipoh town. Do drop by if youâ€™re around the area.
