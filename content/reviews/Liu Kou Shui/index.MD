202C Woodleigh Link #01-32 Woodleigh Village Hawker Center
{{< /lead >}}

Rating: {{< stars 4 >}}

This hawker center is truly a hidden gem. Lots of store options but this spoke out to me with its caramelized cha siew don.
Also this store accepts CDC voucher, so please support local!!

Really wanted to rate 5 stars, but the rice and soup being so underwhelming really held back the true potential.

Charsiew was nicely caramelized and smokey, preferred it to be more charred and crispy tho. What was lacking was the rice with its underwhelming sauce. Honestly at 7 dollars this is still a great steal - 9/10

Spam fries was a good portion for 4.50 dollars, lightly seasoned and wasn’t oily - 9/10

Girlfriends review\
Got the Mentaiko Chicken Don, the chicken was nicely fried and the Mentaiko was an alright portion. The egg was perfectly poached and had a jammy yolk. Overall, quite a yummy but normal dish that I think kids will enjoy more. Also both our meals came with soup that we couldn’t figure out what stock it was. My best guess is fish? 7/10
