I was unable to view the stock profits as it was on her account and I did not have access to the broker. This bot is mostly depreciated now as I now have a proper broker.\nI used python as the main language as I was learning python at the time. Numpy was used to read the data scraped from yahoo using Beatifulsoup4. I used mySQL as the database to store the stock, current price, profit, previous price and the percentage changed of the current vs previous price.\nThese are the commands supported\nList of commands watch - /watch Tickername PriceofStock | If no price is written , the command will fail | if no ticker is written, the bot will send you a list of your current watchlist\nunwatch - /unwatch Tickername | Removes stock from watchlist\nprice - /price Tickername | Get price for current stock\ndividend - /dividend Tickername | /dividend CheckAllYourStockDividends(beta)\nholding - /holding Tickername | Get holdings for an etf\ngainers - /gainers | Top 10 Stock Gainers\nlosers - /losers | Top 10 Stock Losers\nThis was my first project and I learnt alot creating a very simple bot to automate tasks, I also learnt about html tags, divs and Xpath to scrape data. I also used a file to store the Telegram token. Looking back at the code now, it was very poorly done and can be significantly improved.\n","date":"10 May 2020","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/projects/stonks-bot/","section":"My projects","summary":"","title":"CDR-Reader","type":"projects"},{"content":"Feel free to read and give comments\n","date":"15 February 2020","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/reviews/","section":"Timmy \u0026 Cheese Food Reviews","summary":"","title":"Timmy \u0026 Cheese Food Reviews","type":"reviews"},{"content":"\r302 Beach Road #01-04/5 Concourse Skyline\rFood was mediocre and not worth it for the price.
